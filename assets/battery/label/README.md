# ðŸ‘¾ 701c.org / Battery / Label  

Find the full rebuild and walkthrough at [https://701c.org/projects/battery](https://701c.org/projects/battery).

> You're free to print this yourself, or you can purchase a PVC label printed on metallic paper (just like the original) at the [701c.org Shop](https://701c.org/shop).

The label is designed to be an exact match for the original battery and also fits the 3D printed case.

There are two versions with updated battery chemistries:

1. Ni-MH for Nickel Metal Hydryde
2. Li-Po for Lithium Polymer

> The 701c logo is pink in color to denote an area where the metallic silver should show through.
