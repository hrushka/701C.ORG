## An enthusiasts guide to restoring and preserving an iconic portable.

Iâ€™ve made all the walkthroughs, guides, code, and assets Iâ€™ve created available free of charge. They are the results of countless hours of research, experimenting, and learning. I do all of this willingly at my own expense and because I have a passion for creating and preserving.
